# Project Description


Let's say you work for the mining company GlavRosGosNeft. We need to decide where to drill a new well.


The steps to select a location are usually as follows:


* In the selected region, characteristics for wells are collected: the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves;
* They build a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells;
* Wells with the highest estimated values are selected;
* The region with the maximum total profit of the selected wells is determined.


You have been provided with oil samples from three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Analyze the possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.
