# Project Description
The Bread-Solt supermarket chain is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
* Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
* Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol

.
Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people indicating their age.
