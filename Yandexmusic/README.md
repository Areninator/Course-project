# Big city music
## Project Description
The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:
* Moscow is a metropolis, subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
* St. Petersburg is a city of its own culture, unlike Moscow.

Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Businesses must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. Using real Yandex Music data, you will test hypotheses and compare the behavior of users in two capitals.

## Hypotheses

1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning, some genres of music predominate in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. This is also true on Friday evening.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow people listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg they listen to Russian rap.
